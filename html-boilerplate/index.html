        <h1>Cooking Tempeh</h1>

        <h2>The bitter bean jerky</h2>

        <p>
            I refuse to give up on one of the few protiens I can eat.<br>
            So here is the plan. I am not making this shit from scratch.<br>
            I'll be using. 
            <a href="https://lightlife.com/product/original-tempeh/" target="_blank">this tempeh</a> 
            to start.<br>
         </p>

        <h2>Steam out the bitterness</h2>

        <p>
            Apparently the bitter taste comes from amonia which is a by product<br>
            of the fermentation process. Steaming will remove this unpleasant <br>
            taste as well as softening up the tempeh. This will help it to soak <br>
            in the marinade. I will be steaming my tempeh in a rice cooker. The  <br>
            internet reccomends 10 - 15 minutes.
        </p>

        <h2>The Marinade</h2>

        <p>
            We've all mixed some stuff together before. Right? Throw all the stuff<br>
            listed below into a sealable container and mix it up. Then put the steamed<br>
            tempeh inside and put it in the refridgerator for 24 hours. Flip halfway through.<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Tamari</li>
                <li>Liquid smoke</li>
                <li>Smoked paprika</li>
                <li>Black pepper</li>
                <li>Maple syrup</li>
                <li>Vegetable bouillon</li>
            </ul>
        </P>

        <h2>Bake and Baste</h2>

        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 425. Take the tempeh out and save the rest of the marinade.<br>
            Pop it in the oven on a baking sheet for 10 minutes. Then put the rest of the <br>
            marinade over the tempeh and let it cook for another 10 minutes until golden. <br>
            And that should be it. Throw them slices over some rice and enjoy.

         <h2>Conclusion</h2>

         <p>
            Yeah tofu might be a quicker option in a pinch but as a vegan I NEED to expand<br>
            my options. Due to boredom with my options I have started ignoring protein and <br>
            am having a harder time recovering from physical exercise. I probably need to <br>
            be drinking protein powder but I would much rather get my nutrients from my meals.<br>
            Enough about me though, enjoy your fucking tempeh.<br>
