        Tempeh.
        Will you always be a bitter bean jerky?
        I have tried to cook you 3 times to no avail.
        Do these vegans lie about their deliciousness?
        Are they in denial? No. Because I once had a 
        tempeh bacon sandwich from whole foods and it 
        was so scrumptious I got it before work 3
        days in a row. I must learn how to harness the 
        power of tempeh at home so I don't have to buy 
        a $12 dollar sandwich, and keep my money away 
        from amazon.
