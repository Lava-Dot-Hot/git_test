I will format this for html later.

She works Wednesdays

dolly stood just under 6 feet and her gait was rigid but swift. 
She spends most of her time stretching. While she would rather be 
mauling a punching bag the recovery is hell. If she could afford classes
mayber her form would prevent some stress on her body, not to mention 
some instruction on how to stretch correctly. But why does that matter? 
She isn't a fictional character after all. She's got lots of interests.
The other ones don't generate nearly as much sweat though.

Her father, god bless his soul, doesn't want to pay for hearing aids.
<em>he doesnt need them</em>
Dolly doesn't mind being shouted at over every interaction, nor repeating 
myself over and over again. Nah. It's that fucking TV. Being a veteran,
her father takes to the genre of war. He can barely hear it, but he can't
sleep without it. Thus the TV frequently emits High Calibur rifle fire all 
day and night. 

Noise cancelling headphones are the only solution. Talking to him? Why bother
the old man. Confrontation isn't in her nature. The headphones give her control 
of the noise she has to fall asleep to. But she wakes up tired, and ready to 
leave the oppressive racket. When night passes, she spends the day looking for 
the peaceful pockets of the world.

This story has become a bunch of backstory real quick. 
It was meant to be a short story about some young people going to a coffee shop 
every wednesday because they have a crush on the barista but can't admit it to 
themselves. "theyre the only one who makes my drink right!"
Maybe the barista has to change shifts for some reason, and Dolly
can't figure out quite why she is so upset about it. 


Illustrain

There is a serial vandal at the local library. The librarian is trying
to crack the case on her own, since nobody else seems to care enough to 
investigate. "What do you want us to scan every single book for art 
that was designed to be undetectable?" Her boss tells her imaptiently.
"whoever it is, they are undoubtedly talented. The illustrate the books style
perfectly, and add elements that fit in the story seamlessly. Who knows how long they've 
been doing it, how many <em>masterpieces</em> we've yet to discover."
But this librarian reads to the children 3 times a week. She has an intimate 
connection with these books. She doesn't find it cute at all.
